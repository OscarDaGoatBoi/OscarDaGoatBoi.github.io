            <b>  I love mountains and sight seeing</b>. I find it not only calming but also beautiful. I find peace in nature. I would say <b>I am a calm but outgoing person</b>.Some goals I have in life are as follows;I want to explore the world;I would like to start a business one day; My most important goal in life is to make my mom proud.  </p>

            <p>I am a student at <u>Lane Tech</u>.I always grew up with one rule in my household. I must get A's; In middle school, I would go on to get all A's every year and get high school scores in math. But now, in the present day, in high school, I feel like I try my best, but I feel as if my best isn't good enough. A goal I have is to try to finish freshman year with A's and B's.One way I'm going to do this is by studying more and even asking for extra work to improve my grades.</p>

             <p>I was born on September 3, 2010. I am 15  years old. I like to think of myself as a calm person.I enjoy having deep conversations and building strong relationships with people.I also enjoy lifting weights in my freetime after school.My best memory takes place when I was 4 years old and it was the first day of school. I always disliked school to an extent  but back then, I HATED the thought of school.I was crying the whole way there and when I got there my mom and dad kissed me goodbye.I remember thinking that I had to do something , so I decided that when my parents look away, ill make a run for it and leave.What was I going to do when I got out? I didn't think that far .But it never even got that far.When I ran I reached the doors, but I was too short to reach the doors, so I was just standing there reaching for the door looking dumb; My parents just laughed but felt bad at the same time. I still ended up staying in school that day ,but looking back at that moment, I laugh every time. </p>

             <h1 id="chirst" class="text-center">MY LIFE AS A CHRISTIAN</h1>
             <p>I grew up in a christian household where my aunt would always talk and preach God's word to my cousin and I when we were very young.I don't go to church with my mom as much as I should but I do believe in God and that everything happens for a reason.I enjoy hearing about God and speaking about God because it's peaceful and I find comfort in it.When I talk about my faith, I speak from a place of experience, because I’ve felt God’s presence shape my life in ways I can’t ignore. In moments when I’m unsure of myself or overwhelmed by everything happening around me, I turn to Him and find a sense of calm that I can’t get anywhere else. I’ve learned to trust that God is guiding me, even when I don’t fully understand the path He’s taking me on. That trust gives me strength, purpose, and a feeling of being grounded, and it reminds me that I’m never walking through life alone.</p>

             <p>Being a student at Lane Tech College Prep means I’m constantly surrounded by high expectations, and I genuinely push myself to live up to them. I care about my grades and I want to succeed, but I’ll admit that I don’t always make it easy on myself. Sometimes I procrastinate or convince myself I have more time than I really do, and that habit catches up with me when tests or assignments roll around. Even with those setbacks, I’m learning to recognize my patterns and take responsibility for them. Little by little, I’m figuring out how to manage my time better, stay focused, and build the discipline I need to reach the goals I’ve set for myself.</p>
